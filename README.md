# Augment Code MCP (Model Context Protocol)

This repository contains the Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation for Augment Code, enabling seamless integration with various external services.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a core component of Augment Code that facilitates communication between AI models and external services. It provides a standardized way to:

- Access external data sources
- Interact with third-party platforms
- Execute actions in connected systems
- Retrieve contextual information for AI processing

## Supported Integrations

- **Slack MCP**: Enables AI assistants to interact with Slack workspaces, channels, and messages
- Additional integrations are being developed

## How to Use

### Setup Requirements
- **VSCode**: This implementation is optimized for Visual Studio Code
- **Augment Code Extension**: Install the Augment Code extension in VSCode
- **WSL 2**: Running in Windows Subsystem for Linux 2 environment

### Installation Steps
1. Copy the MCP scripts to your local environment
2. Import the configuration using the JSON configuration file
3. Update the paths in the configuration to match your local setup

### Integration with Augment Code
1. Open VSCode with the Augment Code extension installed
2. Configure the extension to use your local MCP implementation
3. Verify the connection between Augment Code and your MCP services
4. Test the integration by executing commands through the Augment Code interface

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure all paths in the configuration are correct for your WSL 2 environment
- Check that environment variables are properly set in your `.env` file
- Verify network connectivity for external service APIs
- Review logs for any connection or authentication errors

## Architecture

The MCP serves as a middleware layer between Augment Code's AI capabilities and external services. It:

1. Translates requests from the AI into service-specific API calls
2. Handles authentication and security
3. Processes and formats responses for AI consumption
4. Manages rate limiting and error handling

## Configuration

Each MCP integration has its own configuration requirements, typically involving:

- API keys and authentication tokens
- Service-specific settings
- Permission scopes
- Environment variables

## Security Considerations

- All authentication credentials are stored locally in `.env` files
- Sensitive information is never committed to version control
- The `.gitignore` file is configured to exclude `.env` files
- MCP implementations follow security best practices for each integrated service

## Development

The MCP architecture is designed to be extensible, allowing for the addition of new service integrations through a standardized interface.
